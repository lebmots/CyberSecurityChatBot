# CyberSecurity Awareness Chatbot
A simple C# console-based chatbot designed to educate users about cybersecurity topics like password safety, phishing, and safe browsing. Built as part of a university programming assignment, the chatbot uses voice greetings, ASCII art, and color-enhanced console output to create an engaging experience.
